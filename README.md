## 30 Days of JavaScript - Repository README

Welcome to my 30 Days of JavaScript repository! This is where I'll be documenting my progress as I embark on a journey to learn and master JavaScript, one day at a time.

### About the Challenge

The "30 Days of JavaScript" challenge is a self-paced learning program designed to help beginners and intermediate developers improve their JavaScript skills. Over the course of 30 days, participants will complete a series of coding exercises, projects, and challenges that cover a wide range of JavaScript concepts and techniques.

### Repository Structure

In this repository, you'll find the following:

#### 1. **Daily Exercises**
Each day's exercise will be stored in a separate folder, named according to the day (e.g., "Day 1", "Day 2", etc.). Within each folder, you'll find the necessary files, code, and any supporting materials for that day's task.

#### 2. **Project Folders**
As I progress through the challenge, I'll be working on various projects. These projects will be stored in their own folders, with detailed documentation and code.

#### 3. **README.md**
This file, which you're currently reading, serves as the main entry point for the repository. It provides an overview of the challenge, the repository structure, and my progress.

### My Progress

I'm excited to embark on this 30-day JavaScript learning journey! I'll be updating this README regularly to track my progress and share my experiences.

- [x] Day 1: Variables and Data Types
- [x] Day 2: Operators
- [x] Day 3: Control Structures

I'm excited to see how much I can learn and grow as a JavaScript developer over the next 30 days. Feel free to follow along, provide feedback, or even join me on this journey!
